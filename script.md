# this would be my strach on how the profloi would look like

first initial settings of the html,
!


## header
back-ground color (if it doesn't work add !impartant)
                    (personally I think it's really dumb that it has to be done that way, might have been interferience from bootstrap)
    <nav>
    (done by flex box)
{fucking failed the header, can't get justify-content to either fucking side}
{but at least have a little more idea on how does flex box work?}



## section below header
back-ground color
    <flexbox>
    <text>      <image>
   for the text, I want to big ass title
   and some smaller text, that's it
   <big ass title> & <smaller texts>
   (&& is a and gate)
and then I can just repeat

## Ok second section, yea
I want it to be white
    <text>
    <img>
so they are still all centered
and lets see whether they fill up the requirements or not stuff like that!
(I think it's going petty well!)

## footer
back-ground color
    <p>
